# tls-scanner

A network security scanner for OpenShift/Kubernetes clusters that combines nmap port scanning with SSL/TLS cipher enumeration and OpenShift component analysis.

## Prerequisites

- **Go environment** - For building the scanner binary.
- **Container tool** - Docker or Podman for building and pushing the scanner image.
- **OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster access** - `oc` or `kubectl` configured to point to your target cluster.
- **Sufficient privileges** - Permissions to create Jobs, and grant `cluster-reader` and `privileged` SCC to a ServiceAccount.

## Installation & Usage

The scanner is designed to be run from within the cluster it is scanning. This is the most reliable way to ensure network access to all pods. The included `deploy.sh` script automates the build and deployment process.

### CI/CD Workflow (Recommended)

This is the recommended approach for automated scanning in an ephemeral test environment.

#### 1. Configure Environment

Set these environment variables in your CI job:

- `SCANNER_IMAGE`: The full tag of the image to build and push (e.g., `quay.io/my-org/tls-scanner:latest`).
- `NAMESPACE`: The OpenShift/Kubernetes namespace where the scanner Job will be deployed (e.g., `scanner-project`). **Note:** This does NOT restrict what gets scanned - it only determines where the scanner runs.
- `NAMESPACE_FILTER`: (Optional) Comma-separated list of namespaces to scan. If not set, the scanner will scan all pods in the entire cluster. Example: `production,staging` to scan only those namespaces.
- `KUBECONFIG`: Path to the kubeconfig file for the ephemeral test cluster.
- `JOB_TEMPLATE_FILE`: (Optional) Path to the Job manifest template used by `deploy.sh deploy` (default: `scanner-job.yaml.template`). For host-based scanning, use a template that runs with host network access (e.g. `scanner-job-microshift.yaml.template`).
- `SCAN_MODE`: (Optional) `pod` (default) or `host`. **Pod mode** discovers pods in the cluster and scans their TLS ports. **Host mode** is for environments where core components (API server, etcd, kubelet) run on the host rather than in pods—e.g. single-node or edge setups such as MicroShift. Use a job template with `hostNetwork: true` and set `SCAN_MODE=host` so the scanner runs on the host and can reach those services.

#### 2. Build and Push the Image

Your CI pipeline needs to be authenticated with your container registry.

```bash
# Build the binary and container image
./deploy.sh build

# Push the image to your registry
./deploy.sh push
```

#### 3. Deploy the Scan Job

This step creates the necessary RBAC permissions and deploys a Kubernetes Job into the ephemeral cluster.

```bash
./deploy.sh deploy
```

#### 4. Wait for Completion and Collect Results

The CI job must wait for the Kubernetes Job to complete and then copy the artifacts out.

```bash
# Wait for the job to finish (adjust timeout as needed)
kubectl wait --for=condition=complete job/tls-scanner-job -n "$NAMESPACE" --timeout=15m

# Get the name of the pod created by the job
POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -n "$NAMESPACE" -l job-name=tls-scanner-job -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

# Create a local directory for artifacts
mkdir -p ./artifacts

# Copy all result files from the pod
kubectl cp "${NAMESPACE}/${POD_NAME}:/artifacts/." "./artifacts/"
```

Your `./artifacts` directory will now contain `results.json`, `results.csv`, and `scan.log`.

### Host-based scanning

In some environments, core cluster components (API server, etcd, kubelet) run on the host instead of as pods. Examples include single-node and edge deployments such as MicroShift. For those setups, use **host** scan mode so the scanner runs with host network access and can discover and scan TLS services bound to the host:

```bash
JOB_TEMPLATE_FILE=scanner-job-microshift.yaml.template SCAN_MODE=host ./deploy.sh deploy
```

Use `JOB_TEMPLATE_FILE` to point at a job template that sets `spec.hostNetwork: true` (and any required security context). The default `scanner-job.yaml.template` is for pod-based scanning only.

## Understanding Scan Results

### CSV Output Columns

The scanner produces a CSV file with detailed information about each scanned port. Key columns include:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| IP | Pod IP address that was scanned |
| Port | TCP port number |
| Protocol | Protocol (typically "tcp") |
| Service | Detected service (e.g., "https", "http") |
| Pod Name | Kubernetes pod name |
| Namespace | Kubernetes namespace |
| Component Name | OpenShift component name extracted from image |
| Process | Process name listening on the port (from lsof) |
| TLS Ciphers | Detected TLS cipher suites |
| TLS Version | Detected TLS versions (e.g., TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3) |
| **Status** | Categorized scan result (see below) |
| **Reason** | Detailed explanation of the status |
| **Listen Address** | Address the port is bound to (e.g., 127.0.0.1, *, 0.0.0.0) |

### Status Categories

The `Status` column categorizes why a port couldn't be scanned or its TLS configuration:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `OK` | TLS scan successful - cipher and version information available |
| `NO_TLS` | Port is open but not using TLS (plain HTTP/TCP service) |
| `LOCALHOST_ONLY` | Port is bound to 127.0.0.1, not accessible from pod IP |
| `FILTERED` | Port blocked by network policy or firewall |
| `CLOSED` | Port not listening on the scanned IP address |
| `MTLS_REQUIRED` | TLS handshake failed - likely requires client certificate |
| `TIMEOUT` | Connection timed out |
| `NO_PORTS` | Pod declares no TCP ports in its spec |
| `ERROR` | Scan error occurred (see Reason for details) |

### Example Output

```csv
IP,Port,Protocol,Service,Pod Name,Namespace,...,Status,Reason,Listen Address
10.128.0.15,8443,tcp,https,kube-apiserver-pod,openshift-kube-apiserver,...,OK,TLS scan successful,*
10.0.53.147,9257,tcp,N/A,controller-manager-pod,openshift-cloud-controller,...,LOCALHOST_ONLY,Bound to 127.0.0.1 not accessible from pod IP,127.0.0.1
10.0.87.193,10258,tcp,N/A,aws-ccm-pod,openshift-cloud-controller,...,FILTERED,Network policy or firewall blocking access,N/A
10.128.0.20,8080,tcp,http,metrics-pod,openshift-monitoring,...,NO_TLS,Port open but no TLS detected (plain HTTP/TCP),*
```

### Interpreting Results

1. **LOCALHOST_ONLY ports**: These are internal-only ports bound to 127.0.0.1. They're only accessible from within the pod itself and don't pose external TLS compliance concerns. Common for metrics endpoints that are scraped via sidecar containers.

2. **FILTERED ports**: The scanner couldn't reach these ports due to network policies, firewall rules, or the service not listening on the pod IP. Review network policies if you need to scan these.

3. **NO_TLS ports**: These ports are open but don't use TLS. This may be expected (e.g., health check endpoints, plaintext metrics) or may indicate a security concern depending on the data transmitted.

4. **MTLS_REQUIRED ports**: Common for etcd (ports 2379/2380) and other services requiring mutual TLS. The scanner can't complete the handshake without a client certificate.

#### 5. Cleanup

Remove the scanner Job and associated RBAC permissions from the cluster.

```bash
./deploy.sh cleanup
```

### Manual Usage

You can also run the steps manually.

1.  **Build the image:** `export SCANNER_IMAGE="your-registry/image:tag"` and run `./deploy.sh build`.
2.  **Push the image:** `./deploy.sh push`.
3.  **Deploy the job:** `export NAMESPACE="scanner-project" NAMESPACE_FILTER="production"` and run `./deploy.sh deploy`
4.  **Monitor and retrieve results** as shown in the CI workflow.
5.  **Clean up** with `./deploy.sh cleanup`.

### `deploy.sh` Script Actions

-   `build`: Builds the `tls-scanner` binary and container image.
-   `push`: Pushes the container image to the registry specified by `$SCANNER_IMAGE`.
-   `deploy`: Deploys the scanner Kubernetes Job to the cluster specified by `$KUBECONFIG` and `$NAMESPACE`.
-   `cleanup`: Removes the scanner Job and RBAC resources.
-   `full-deploy` (or no action): Runs `build`, `push`, and `deploy`.

### Command Line Options

The scanner binary accepts the following command-line options. These are configured in the `scanner-job.yaml.template` file.

```bash
./tls-scanner [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `-host <ip>` - Target host/IP to scan (default: 127.0.0.1)
